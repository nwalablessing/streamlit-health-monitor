Sepsis is a rapidly progressing and life-threatening condition that remains a leading cause of mortality in intensive care units (ICUs), primarily due to delayed diagnosis and intervention. This study presents a scalable, real-time sepsis prediction and monitoring system that combines machine learning with wearable health technologies to enable early detection and proactive clinical decision-making. Trained on the PhysioNet Sepsis Challenge 2019 dataset, our XGBoost model achieved 97.67\% accuracy and an AUC-ROC of 0.83. The model is deployed via a Streamlit web app supporting manual predictions and real-time monitoring using Amazfit Bip 5 smartwatches, with data streamed through Zepp and Strava APIs. A Telegram bot enables automated alerts and medication reminders. This comprehensive system improves early detection, enhances communication between clinicians and patients, and supports clinical decision-making, ultimately reducing ICU mortality.
